# Brooklyn Nets Face Recognizer

Note: Before using, run: "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required packages.

## How to use the program
When "nets_detection.py" is run, it will create three files that "face_rec.py" will reference.

To start the program, run "face_rec.py", which will load up your webcam. When there is 1 blue box around your face, press SPACE to take a screenshot. The webcam window will close, and the resulting screenshot will open. The name of the player will be shown in the top left of the screen.
